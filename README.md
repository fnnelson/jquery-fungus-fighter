# jQuery Fungus Fighter

Fight mutant fungus villains, with jQuery!

![demo](demo.gif)

It is you versus the Freaky Fungus, an evil mycological menace from mars. Use your jQuery skills to dispatch attacks against your enemy. To win, the Freaky Fungus must have 0 hit points (HP) before you are out of attack points (AP).



## Requirements

**Handle click events:** 

When you click an attack button:

-  update _state_ variable(s) to make the Freaky Fungus lose hit points (HP), and to reduce your attack points (AP). 
- See [Attacks](#attacks) below, for the AP and HP values of each attack
- State may be held in one our more variables of your choosing
- HP and AP values may not be negative (set to zero, if they would otherwise be negative)


**Render state changes to the DOM**

- Update the text above the attack buttons (eg, "100 AP")
- Update the text above the enemy fungus (eg, "100 HP")
- If the Freaky Fungus runs out of HP, the monster is dead and you win! Replace the `walk` class with a `dead` class on the freaky-fungus element, to make them fall over and die.
- If you run out of AP, the monster wins and humanity is doomed ðŸ˜¢ Replace the `walk` class with a `jump` class on the freaky-fungus element, to make them jump for the glory of the fungal race.
  - You may no longer attack, if AP is `0`. Give all of the attack buttons a [`disabled`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_button_disabled.asp) attribute, so they may no longer be used. 

## Stretch Goals

**Progress Bar**

When state changes:
  - Update the value of each `<progress>` element

> Hint: the jQuery `.val()` method updates the `value` attribute of HTML elements!

**HP Regeneration**

[Scientist have recently revealed](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05715-9) that fungi are tougher under harsh conditions.

If the Freaky Fungus' HP falls below 50, have it regenerate 1 HP every second.

> HINT: Look up the built in `setInterval()` function!
